# Design Fundamentals

## Typography

- Use a font style between 15 and 25 pixels
- Use really big font sizes for headlines, decrease the font weight when using big fonts
- Use line spacing between 120 and 150%
- 45 to 90 characters per line
- Use good fonts, generally sans-serif for clean, simple and modern websites i.e. Open Sans, Lato, Raleway, Monsterrat, PT Sans. If you need serif for lots of text, then use a Sans Serif header with Cardo, Merriweather or PT Serif for main corpus

## Colours

- Use only one base colour, have a look at flat UI colours http://www.0to255.com/
- Use a tool if you want to use more colours. Use main colour to bring people into your call to action
- Never use black in your design
- Choose colours wisely:
 - Red is a great colour to use when power, passion, strength and excitement want to be transmitted. Brighter tones are more energetic and darker shades are more powerful and elegant.
 - Orange draws attention without being as overpowering as red. It means cheerfulness and creativity. Orange can be associated with friendliness, confidence, and courage.
 - Yellow is energetic and gives the feeling of happiness and liveliness. Also, it associates with curiosity, intelligence, brightness, etc.
 - Green is the colour of harmony, nature, life and health. Also, it is often associated with money. In design, green can have a balancing and harmonizing effect.
 - Blue means patience, peace, trustworthiness, and stability. It is one of the most beloved colours, especially by men. It is associated with professionalism, trust and honour. That's actually why the biggest social networks use blue.
 - Purple is traditionally associated with power, nobility and wealth. In your design, purple can give a sense of wisdom, royalty, nobility, luxury, and mystery.
 - Pink expresses romance, passivity, care, peace, affection, etc.
 - Brown is the colour of relaxation and confidence. Brown means earthiness, nature, durability, comfort, and reliability.


## Images

- Put text directly on an image
- Overlay the image with a colour by using gradient, such as black.
- Put text in a box, which is opaque
- Blur the image or use an out of focus image
- The floor fade where the image fades to black below it

## Icons

- Use icons to list features and steps
 - Icons should be recognisable
 - Label icons where applicable
- Icons should not take the centre stage
- Use icon fonts whenever possible

## Spacing and layout

- Use whitespace by putting whitespace between elements, between groups of elements and between sections
- Define hierarchy
 - Define where we want audience to look first
 - Establish flow which corresponds to message
 - Use whitespace to build that flow


## User Experience

-  How does it work?
